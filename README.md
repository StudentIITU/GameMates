Activities: The activities folder contains the main activities of the app:

LoginActivity: Handles user login and authentication.

RegistrationActivity: Manages user registration and data storage in Firebase.

HomePageActivity: The central hub of the app after login, likely containing features for user interaction and game-related activities.

Development Roles:
Damir (Backend): Responsible for the core logic, data handling, and backend integration.
Arlen (Frontend): Focused on UI/UX design, layout creation, and visual elements.
Core Functionality

The primary goal of GameMates is to address the lack of dedicated platforms for gamer communication and interaction. The app aims to provide features that facilitate:
User Authentication: Secure login and registration using Firebase.

Gamer Connections: Mechanisms for users to find and connect with other gamers.
Communication: Chat functionalities or other means for users to interact.
(Potentially) Game-Related Features: Integration with game APIs, game statistics, or other features relevant to gaming.
Technical Details:
Programming Language: Kotlin (likely with some Java)
Backend: Firebase for authentication and potentially data storage.
UI Framework: Android's native UI toolkit (XML layouts, Activities, etc.)
Additional Notes:
More specific details about algorithms, data structures, and design patterns can be added as the project progresses and these aspects are further developed.
Consider including information about testing approaches and examples of how to use the core features of the code.
